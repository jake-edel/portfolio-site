            <p>Jakob Edelstein is an aspiring software developer. In my previous career, I designed 
                and built steel architectural products for a metal fabrication company. After expanding 
                my skill set into software development, attending classes at the Turing School of 
                Software and Design, I'm currently a software development intern with a new fabrication company, which 
                uses software to interface with CAD systems and drive fabrication design and shop operations.</p>
